* =tex-join-bib=

** Description

Automatically join several =tex= files together by compiling each file
separately (to keep their formatting and configuration) but unify their
bibliographies into a =pdf=. =tex-join-bib= will also output the joined =bib=
file, bibliography =tex= file, and a =pdf= of the joined references.

** Installation

=tex-join-bib= requires an installation of latex (like =texlive=), =latexmk=,
and =pdfjam=.
